The hospital gave us access to ten years of information on patients readmitted to the hospital after being discharged. The doctors want to assess if initial diagnoses, number of procedures, or other variables could help them understand the probability of readmission. They want to focus follow-up calls and attention on those patients with a higher probability of readmission.\n","\n","## Goal\n","1. Analyze the primary diagnosis with the highest readmission rate and its pattern in the dataset.\n","2. Build a predictive model to predict if a patient will be readmitted within 30-days after discharge.\n","3. Identify the group of patients the hospital needs to focus its follow-up effort to better monitor patients with high probability of readmission.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0EP6AMa_GJWh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a id=\"eda\"></a>\n","# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Patient Readmission Dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"HbLiDsnyGzbR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a id=\"data_dictionary\"></a>\n","## Data Dictionary\n","\n","|Name|Description|Type|\n","|----|-----------|----|\n","|age|age bracket of the patient|string|\n","|time_in_hospital|days (from 1 to 14)|numeric|\n","|n_procedures|number of procedures performed during the hospital stay|numeric|\n","|n_lab_procedures| number of laboratory procedures performed during the hospital stay|numeric|\n","|n_medications| number of medications administered during the hospital stay|numeric|\n","|n_outpatient| number of outpatient visits in the year before a hospital stay|numeric|\n","|n_inpatient| number of inpatient visits in the year before the hospital stay|numeric|\n","|n_emergency| number of visits to the emergency room in the year before the hospital stay|numeric|\n","|medical_specialty| the specialty of the admitting physician|string|\n","|diag_1| primary diagnosis (Circulatory, Respiratory, Digestive, etc.)|string|\n","|diag_2| secondary diagnosis|string|\n","|diag_3| additional secondary diagnosis|string|\n","|glucose_test| whether the glucose serum came out as high (> 200), normal, or not performed|string|\n","|A1Ctest| whether the A1C level of the patient came out as high (> 7%), normal, or not performed|string|\n","|change| whether there was a change in the diabetes medication ('yes' or 'no')|string|\n","|diabetes_med| whether a diabetes medication was prescribed ('yes' or 'no')|string|\n","|readmitted| if the patient was readmitted at the hospital ('yes' or 'no') |string|\n","\n","Assumptions:\n","1.
